# suggestion from MTM:

    Each lap is a member in an array. In ETL I run the same code for
    each listing. So for 1.000 listings I can have 5.000 laps. Those
    laps have only 5 distinct names.
    
    What I do is
    my $laps = $stopwatch_data->{'laps'};
    my %stopwatch_times = ();
    foreach my $lap (@$laps) {
        my $name = $lap->{'name'};
        $stopwatch_times{$name} ||= 0;
        $stopwatch_times{$name} += $lap->{'time'};
        $stopwatch_times{'_total_'} += $lap->{'time'};
    }
    
    foreach my $key ( keys %stopwatch_times ){
      print $key . ': ' . $stopwatch_times{$key} . "\n";
    }
    
    My suggestion is to add a method 'collapse' that will collapse
    same names. The user of the module would have to explicitly
    call it.
